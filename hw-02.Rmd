# Overview

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load libraries for homework problems
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(patchwork)
# Read in COVID19 data
cv19 <- read_csv('data/usa_covid19.csv')

cv19

```

# Problem 1

Create two new columns in `cv19`: 

- `cases_new` the number of _new_ cases identified on a given day for a given state.

- `deaths_new` the number of _new_ deaths confirmed on a given day for a given state.


__Notes__: 

- the lag function is helpful for this.

- Your solution should look like this

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/01_solution.rds')

```

# Problem 2

Compute the total number of new cases identified and deaths confirmed each day in the USA on or after March 1st, 2020. Your summarized data should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/02_solution.rds')

```


# Problem 3

Using the data created in problem 2, create two bar plots showing the number of new cases identified and deaths confirmed in the USA after March 1st, 2020.

__Notes__ This is a great chance to learn about the [patchwork R package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/). 

Your solution should look like this

```{r, fig.width=10}

read_rds('solutions/03_solution.rds')

```


# Problem 4

Add four new columns to the data you created in problem 1:

- `cases_per100k`: Number of cases per 100,000 citizens 
- `deaths_per100k`: Number of deaths per 100,000 citizens
- `cases_dbl_days`: Number of days until case count doubles, based on current day's case count 
- `deaths_dbl_days`: Number of days until death count doubles, based on current day's death count. 

__Challenge yourself__: 

- filter the data you have created in this problem to contain only the most recent day. 

- Identify the 10 states that have the highest death rate per 100,000 citizens. 

- Tabulate the total number, rate, and days to double for cases and deaths in each of these 10 states. 

Your solution should look like this: 

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/04_solution.rds')

```


# Problem 5

__Learn something new__: take a look at a famous [flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/racing_bars/racing_barcharts.html#1) created by Gina Reynolds. The `cv19` data have a very similar structure to that of the flipbook in Gina's talk. Learn about the `ggplot2` tools that are used in the flipbook and try to adapt them to create the 'racing bar chart' below.
